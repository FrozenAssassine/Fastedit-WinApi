# Fastedit-WinApi

Fastedit is one of my first bigger programming projects, which I've started when I was 13 years old. It is written in C++ using the Windows-Api.
I am not working on it anymore, so the code here won't change much.

#### I would not really recommend to use it, as your main texteditor, because it still has bugs, and can crash anytime.
